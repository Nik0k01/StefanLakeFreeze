1. Create mesh                                                  |
    1. Define the number of points in X and Y direction.        | dimX, dimY = ...
    2. Define the shape of the system.                          | shape = 'circle'
    3. Define the size of the system.                           | size = 1.
    4. Construct the geometry                                   | geometry = form_geometry(shape, size)
    5. Create X coordinate matrix.                              | 
    6. Create Y coordinate matrix.                              | X, Y = create_mesh(dimX, dimY, geometry)
    7. Pack everything into a mesh class                        | mesh = Mesh(...)
2. Define boundary conditions                                   |
    1. Define heat coefficients, dirichlet temperatures etc.    | q, Tinf, Td = [...]
    2. For each boundary assign boundary condition              | for boundary_type in boundary_list:
                                                                |   boundary_... = boundary_type
    3. Pack everyting into a Boundary class                     | boundary = Boundary(...)
3. Define time stepping scheme                                  |
    1. Define end time                                          | t_end = 1000
    2. Define step size                                         | dt = 0.1
    3. Calculate number of steps                                | step_no = int(t_end/dt)
    4. Define time stepping scheme                              | time_schme = 'backwardEuler' or 'crankNicholson'
    5. Pack everyting into time discretization class            | timeDiscretization = TimeDiscretization(...)
4. Create a unsteady FVM solver object                          | stefanSolver = UnsteadyFVM(mesh, boundary, timeDiscretization)
5. Solve the Stefan Problem                                     | solution = stefanSolver.solve()
6. Save the results into a csv file for later analysis          | with open('results.txt', 'w') as f:
                                                                |   f.write(solution)
